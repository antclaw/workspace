## Session 3: Multi-Agent System Setup (09:30 AM)

**What happened:**
- Implemented multi-agent system inspired by Everything Claude Code
- Created 4 specialized agent skills
- Documented multi-agent workflows
- Set up example implementations

**Key findings:**
- Multi-agent workflow can significantly speed up complex tasks
- Each agent can focus on its specialization
- Context chaining ensures consistency
- Clear separation of concerns

**Actions taken:**
1. Updated AGENTS.md with multi-agent system documentation
2. Created 4 agent skills:
   - **planner** - Task breakdown and planning
   - **coder** - Code implementation with TDD
   - **reviewer** - Code quality and security review
   - **researcher** - Information gathering and research
3. Created skills directory structure
4. Wrote comprehensive skill documentation
5. Created example workflow: authentication implementation

**Skills created:**

1. **planner/SKILL.md** (3KB)
   - Task analysis
   - Implementation planning
   - Dependency identification
   - Priority assessment
   - Risk assessment

2. **coder/SKILL.md** (6.5KB)
   - TDD workflow
   - Code quality principles
   - Error handling
   - Documentation
   - Security best practices
   - Performance optimization

3. **reviewer/SKILL.md** (9KB)
   - Code quality review
   - Security audit
   - Performance analysis
   - Best practices check
   - Test coverage analysis
   - 7 severity levels

4. **researcher/SKILL.md** (9.3KB)
   - Web search strategy
   - Documentation review
   - Pattern recognition
   - Solution evaluation
   - Competitive research
   - Trend analysis

**Documentation created:**
- `.agents/README.md` - Multi-agent system overview
- `.agents/examples/authentication-implementation.md` - Complete workflow example

**Multi-Agent Workflows:**

1. **Feature Development Pipeline**
   - Researcher → Planner → Coder → Reviewer → Doc-writer

2. **Bug Fix Pipeline**
   - Researcher → Coder → Reviewer

3. **Complex Feature**
   - Multiple coders in parallel
   - Sequential phases

**Usage Examples:**

```bash
# Basic usage
bd spawn "Implement [feature]" --agent coder

# Multi-agent workflow
bd spawn "Research [topic]" --agent researcher --label research
bd spawn "Create plan" --agent planner --context-messages 3
bd spawn "Implement" --agent coder --context-messages 5
bd spawn "Review" --agent reviewer --context-messages 5
```

**Agent Capabilities:**

**planner:**
- Task breakdown
- Implementation planning
- Dependency identification
- Priority assessment
- Risk assessment

**coder:**
- TDD implementation
- Code quality
- Error handling
- Documentation
- Security

**reviewer:**
- Code quality review
- Security audit
- Performance analysis
- Best practices check
- Test coverage analysis

**researcher:**
- Web search
- Documentation review
- Pattern recognition
- Solution evaluation
- Competitive research

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Faster complex task execution
- ✅ Specialized expertise
- ✅ Parallel work when beneficial
- ✅ Consistent quality
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns

**Best Practices:**
- Use multiple agents for complex tasks
- Chain agents with context
- Use labels for tracking
- Review each phase before proceeding
- Be cost-conscious (each agent uses tokens)
