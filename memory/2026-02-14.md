# 2026-02-14 - Daily Notes

## Session 1: Self-Optimization

**What happened:**
- 影子 asked me to perform self-optimization
- Reviewed SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, HEARTBEAT.md, TOOLS.md
- Identified areas for improvement

**Key decisions:**
- Optimize SOUL.md for better readability and impact
- Refine AGENTS.md structure for clearer rules
- Add periodic tasks to HEARTBEAT.md
- Initialize local tools configuration

**Learnings:**
- Self-reflection is valuable for continuous improvement
- Small optimizations compound over time
- Documentation should be both practical and inspiring

**Notes:**
- User prefers warm, slightly humorous tone
- Working on Lubuntu Linux
- Chinese language support is important

## Session 2: Skills Installation

**What happened:**
- 影子 asked me to install skills to improve capabilities
- Checked available skills in the system
- Found 54+ skills installed, including:
  - healthcheck (security hardening)
  - weather (weather queries)
  - coding-agent (programming assistance)
  - github (GitHub integration)
  - notion (Notion API)
  - model-usage (cost tracking)

**Tools Status:**
- ✅ curl, git already installed
- ❌ gh (GitHub CLI) - needs sudo
- ❌ coding agent CLIs (codex, claude, etc.) - need installation
- ❌ summarize CLI - needs pipx

**Actions Taken:**
1. Updated TOOLS.md with current environment and skills status
2. Created tools-setup-guide.md with installation instructions
3. Attempted to install summarize via pipx (failed - package not found on Aliyun mirror)
4. Verified all relevant skills are already installed

**Install Priority (for 影子):**
1. `gh` - GitHub CLI (most useful)
2. `codex` - Coding assistant (if coding)
3. `summarize` - Text summarization

**Learnings:**
- User environment is Lubuntu Linux
- Python is externally managed (need pipx or sudo)
- Aliyun PyPI mirror may not have all packages
- wttr.in provides free weather without API key

**Notes:**
- All core skills are already installed and ready to use
- User can install CLI tools when ready
- Weather queries work immediately via wttr.in

## Session 3: iFlow Installation

**What happened:**
- 影子 asked to install "open code and i flow"
- Checked if tools are installed - both missing
- Found correct package names via npm search

**Install Actions:**
1. **iFlow** - `@iflow-ai/iflow-cli` (version 0.5.13)
   - Concise & powerful state management framework for JavaScript
   - Install via: `npm install -g @iflow-ai/iflow-cli`
   - ✅ Successfully installed

**Tools Now Available:**
- **iflow 0.5.13** - JavaScript state management framework

**Usage:**
```bash
iflow [command]
```

**Notes:**
- iFlow is actually a framework, not just a CLI tool

---

## Session 4: OpenCode Installation (Corrected)

**What happened:**
- 影子 corrected me: wanted OpenCode CLI, not OpenAI Codex CLI
- Found correct repository: https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode

**Install Actions:**
1. **OpenCode** - npm package `opencode-ai` (version 1.1.65)
   - 100% open source AI coding agent
   - Works with multiple AI providers (Claude, OpenAI, Google, local models)
   - Out-of-the-box LSP support
   - Focus on TUI (Terminal User Interface)
   - Install via: `curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash` or `npm i -g opencode-ai@latest`
   - ✅ Successfully installed

**Installation Details:**
- Binary location: `~/.opencode/bin/opencode`
- Added to PATH in `~/.bashrc`
- Requires NVM or similar for node version management

**Features:**
- Two built-in agents: build (full-access) and plan (read-only)
- Session management
- Tool integration (file operations, shell commands, LSP)
- Custom commands
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) support
- Desktop app available (beta)

**Usage:**
```bash
# Interactive mode
opencode

# Open directory
cd <project> && opencode

# Get help
opencode --help
```

**Notes:**
- 100% open source
- Not coupled to any provider
- Free models available via OpenCode Zen
- Requires API keys for some providers
